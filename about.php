                 Donating is a generous thing to do. It helps people in need,
                 and it helps people in your community. When you give, others 
                 live. Donors, especially those who donate regularly, keep our
                 nation's blood supply stable. 			</p>

                government and advocacy groups over the years have helped
                bridge the gap between demand and supply. .			</p>
